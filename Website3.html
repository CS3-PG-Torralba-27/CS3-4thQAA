			<h2> What is CYBERSECURITY and what is it all about? </h2>
			<p> Cybersecurity is a multidisciplinary field focused on protecting computer systems, 
				networks, programs, and data from digital attacks. 
				It encompasses various technologies, processes, and practices aimed at safeguarding 
				sensitive information, maintaining the integrity of systems, and ensuring the 
				availability of essential services. </p>

			<p class = "breakdown"> Here's a breakdown of what Cybersecurity entails: </p>
			<h3> Protecting against Cyber Threats: </h3> 
			<p> Cyber threats, such as malware, phishing attacks, ransomware, and hacking attempts, pose significant risks to individuals, organizations, and governments. Cybersecurity measures aim to detect, prevent, and respond to these threats effectively. </p>
			<h3> Ensuring Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability: </h3>  
			<p> Cybersecurity efforts often revolve around the CIA triad: Confidentiality (ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users), Integrity (maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data), and Availability (ensuring data and systems are accessible when needed). </p>
			<h3> Implementing Security Controls: </h3> 
			<p> Security controls, including firewalls, encryption, access controls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software, are deployed to protect against cyber threats. These controls are often part of a layered defense strategy, known as defense-in-depth. </p>
			<h3> Risk Management: </h3> 
			<p> Cybersecurity involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks to information assets. This includes conducting risk assessments, developing security policies and procedures, and implementing security controls based on the identified risks. </p>
			<h3> Incident Response and Recovery: </h3> 
			<p> Security incidents can still occur despite preventive measures. Cybersecurity teams must be prepared to respond swiftly to security breaches, investigate incidents, contain the damage, and restore systems and data to normal operation. </p>
			<h3> Compliance and Regulation: </h3> 
			<p> Many industries and organizations are subject to cybersecurity regulations and compliance requirements. Compliance efforts ensure that organizations adhere to industry standards and legal obligations regarding protecting sensitive information. </p>
			<h3> Cybersecurity Awareness and Training: </h3> 
			<p> Human factors play a crucial role in cybersecurity. Training programs and awareness campaigns help educate users about best practices, security policies, and the importance of maintaining good cyber hygiene to mitigate risks. </p>
			<p> Overall, cybersecurity is an ongoing effort that requires collaboration among technology experts, policymakers, business leaders, and individuals to address cyber threats' evolving landscape and effectively protect digital assets. </p>
