			<h2> What are Cybersecurity measures? </h2>
			<p> Cybersecurity measures encompass a broad range of practices, technologies, 
				and policies designed to protect computer systems, networks, and data from 
				unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. </p>
		</div>

			<p class = "breakdown"> Here are some essential cybersecurity measures: </p>
			<h3> Firewalls: </h3> 
			<p> Firewalls are network security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as a barrier between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, such as the Internet. </p>
			<h3> Antivirus and Antimalware Software: </h3>  
			<p> Antivirus and Antimalware Software detects, prevents, and removes malicious software, such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware, from computer systems. </p>
			<h3> Access Control: </h3> 
			<p> Access Control mechanisms enforce policies that determine who is allowed to access resources or perform actions within a computer system or network. This includes user authentication, authorization, and accountability. </p>
			<h3> Encryption: </h3> 
			<p> Encryption transforms data into an unreadable format using cryptographic algorithms, making it unintelligible to unauthorized parties. This helps protect data confidentiality, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information. </p>
			<h3> Patch Management: </h3> 
			<p> Patch Management involves regularly updating software and firmware to address security vulnerabilities and software bugs identified by vendors or developers. Prompt patching helps prevent the exploitation of known vulnerabilities by attackers. </p>
			<h3> Security Awareness Training: </h3> 
			<p> Educating employees and users about cybersecurity best practices, and threats, and how to recognize and respond to security incidents is crucial for maintaining a secure environment. Training can help reduce the risk of social engineering attacks and human errors that could compromise security. </p>
			<h3> Incident Response Plan: </h3> 
			<p> Developing and implementing an incident response plan enables organizations to effectively respond to and mitigate cybersecurity incidents when they occur. This includes procedures for detecting, analyzing, containing, eradicating, and recovering from security breaches or incidents. </p>
			<h3> Data Backup and Recovery: </h3> 
			<p> Regularly backing up critical data and implementing robust data recovery procedures are essential for mitigating the impact of data breaches, ransomware attacks, hardware failures, or other disasters that could result in data loss. </p>
			<h3> Network Segmentation: </h3> 
			<p> Network Segmentation involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments or subnetworks to control and restrict the flow of traffic, limiting the potential impact of security breaches or lateral movement by attackers. </p>
			<h3> Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): </h3> 
			<p> Multi-factor authentication requires users to provide multiple forms of verification, such as passwords, biometrics, security tokens, or one-time codes, to access accounts or systems, adding an extra layer of security beyond passwords alone. </p>
