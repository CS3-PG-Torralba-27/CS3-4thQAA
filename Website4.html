			<h2> What are Cybersecurity threats and their types? </h2>
			<p> Cybersecurity threats encompass a wide range of malicious activities 
				that aim to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of 
				computer systems, networks, and data. </p>
		</div>
		
		<div class = "def2"> 
			<p class = "breakdown"> Here are some essential cybersecurity measures: </p>
			<h3> Malware: </h3> 
			<p> Malicious software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer system. This includes viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and adware. </p>
			<h3> Phishing: </h3>  
			<p> Phishing attacks involve tricking users into providing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data by posing as a trustworthy entity in an email or other communication. </p>
			<h3> Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS): </h3> 
			<p> DoS attacks overwhelm a system with traffic or requests, causing it to become slow or unavailable. DDoS attacks involve multiple sources attacking a single target simultaneously, making it even harder to mitigate. </p>
			<h3> Man-in-the-Middle (MitM): </h3> 
			<p> In MitM attacks, an attacker intercepts communication between two parties, potentially eavesdropping on or altering the data transmitted. </p>
			<h3> SQL Injection: </h3> 
			<p> SQL Injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to inject malicious SQL code into a query, enabling attackers to access, modify, or delete data from databases. </p>
			<h3> Zero-Day Exploits: </h3> 
			<p> Zero-Day Exploits target vulnerabilities in software or hardware that are unknown to the vendor or developers. Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities before a fix or patch is available. </p>
			<h3> Insider Threats: </h3> 
			<p> Insider Threats involve malicious actions or data breaches perpetrated by individuals within an organization, such as employees, contractors, or business partners. </p>
			<h3> Social Engineering: </h3> 
			<p> Social Engineering attacks manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security, often through psychological manipulation or deception. </p>
			<h3> Cryptojacking: </h3>
			<p> Cryptojacking involves hijacking a victim's computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without their consent or knowledge. </p>
			<h3> IoT Vulnerabilities: </h3> 
			<p> Internet of Things (IoT) devices often lack robust security measures, making them vulnerable to attacks that exploit weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or control. </p>
			<h3> Supply Chain Attacks: </h3> 
			<p> Supply Chain Attacks target the software supply chain, aiming to compromise software updates or dependencies to distribute malware or gain unauthorized access to systems. </p>
			<h3> Password Attacks </h3>
			<p> Password attacks involve various methods, such as brute force or dictionary attacks, to guess or steal passwords and gain unauthorized access to accounts or systems. </p>
